critical tools for making it a reasonable vector drawing/editing program
  static slope analysis
    mark peaks for curve points
    some kind of filter for ignoring small changes in direction
  actual corner nodes
  post-metaheuristic review and alteration
    chance to add/remove nodes, set corners
    with the option to change how the connection to the last line was interpreted (corner, smooth)
  drawing from already existing line endings
  selection tool
    at least the ability to select indiviudal points and whole curves
      maybe with shift-click to move from point selection to curves
  transposition tool

ideal features
  slope analysis
    much better corner detection, current way does not work well
  performance, computational
    improve distance map algorithm by interpolating between line segments, it's too rough
  performance, metaheuristic
    add tangent-line to fitness, sourced from the analysis
