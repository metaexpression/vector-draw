# vector-draw
Prototype tool for converting hand-drawn lines into clean vectors, using Canvas. The core of the library is a metaheuristic processes,
seeded with an algorithmic analysis of the drawn curve. This structure theoretically allows for further refining and tweaks of the smoothed curve as a combined post-process tool,
by retaining the metaheuristic data, but no part of this is implimented yet.
